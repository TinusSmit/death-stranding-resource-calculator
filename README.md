# Death Stranding Resource Calculator
A simple tool to calculate the appropriate amount of materials to claim for a given road / structure.

## Overview
So you're thinking "I'd like to build a road" and then you look at the required materials and you see this:

Then it hits you "How many ceramics do I need to claim?"

![Ceramics Breakdown!](/docs/img/CeramicsBreakdown.jpeg "Ceramics breakdown")

This tool will help you calculate the most efficient number of each unit to claim at your various cities, distribution centers, or preppers.

The minimum data required here is the total cost and how much has been submitted already, and the tool will reveal how many of each material unit is needed to get as close to the required number as possible. However, it's useful to add a name to keep track of multiple roads / structures that you want to build.

It's not an incredibly fancy tool (it's an Excel file with some formulas), but if your goal is to build all of the roads in the game then this will save you a lot of time and mental arithmetic.

This isn't limited to roads, you can use this when planning to build / upgrade structures. That's why I've included sheets for every resource type and their units.

I hope you find this useful 😃
